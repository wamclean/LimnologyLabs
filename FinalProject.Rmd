#### **Introduction [5 points].**

Horsetooth Reservoir is a six and one quarter mile long reservoir located just West of Fort Collins, CO. It was completed in 1949 and made its first releases to the Poudre River in July of 1951. Horsetooth has a capacity of 156,735 acre-feet, 25 miles of shoreline, and a maximim depth of 188 feet (Horsetooth Reservoir \| Northern Water). It was created as part of the Colorado-Big Thompson project, which aimed to supply the east slope with water for drinking, irrigation, and hydropower from the west slope. It is jointly managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, and Larimer County (Horsetooth Reservoir \| Larimer County).

#### **Methods [5 points].**

**For full credit you must include:**

**A description of the sampling effort including an overview of which samples were taken and why.** **A map of Horsetooth Reservoir with our sampling location clearly identified. Image should include a caption. Map can either be inserted into your R Markdown as an image or created in R using a code block.**

#### Results (figures and calculations) [27 points]

**A presentation of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the water column where we sampled.**

**Did you remove any of the points from your curve? Why or why not?**

Yes, I removed the point where the Area value was 249.1000 because it appeared to be an outlier. Doing so resulted in a change in my R-squared value from 0.9998 to 0.9999

###### Figure 10: Secchi Depth by observer, observations from Group 10 have been omitted as their notation was deemed unreliable

e.  In some cases, not every group took samples for each water quality property, or they took them with the incorrect procedure, or their data is not realistic. Thus, before calculating class means, you should filter out missing data and data from groups who you think is not reliable (include an explanation of this filtering out in the Results (interpretation) section below). If you think your own group’s data is unreliable, still create a figure with the filtered class data and your group’s data if it exists, but also include a note in the Results (interpretation) section below explaining the circumstances; also, rely on the filtered pooled class data values to answer any subsequent questions.

#### Results (interpretation) [18 points]. For full credit please:

Describe each of the figures you created. Comment on any trends or contrasts that are apparent within each figure.

Figure 1:

These Dissolved Oxygen Profiles show nearly identical trends, concentration of dissovled oxygen is high at the surface and gradually drops. Between 10m and 15m concentration drops significantly and continues to do so over short depth intervals, reaching zero somewhere between 20 and 25m depth.

Figure 2:

The temperature profiles show the division between the Epilimnion, Metalimnion, and Hypolimnion with some clarity. Group 1's data shows that temperature remains relatively uniform, right above or below 21 degrees C until about 9m depth, it then quickly falls to \~16.5 degrees C and between 20 and 22.5m depth falls sharply to below 13.5 degrees C. Group 3's data is less consistent but shows a similar trend, the variation may be due to unreliable depth readings when lowering the sond, as the boats we were on were not secured at two points to prevent drifting which can affect depth readings.

Figure 3:

This pH profile shows an interesting trend. Beginning with Group 6's data, we can see pH at the surface is between 7.3 and 7.4, and it gradually rises to \~7.55 at about 7.5m depth, before falling to \~7.3 just below 15m depth. Below 15m pH readings vary significantly at each measurement interval.

Group 3's data shows more extreme variance in readings, we attribute this to movement of the boat altering measurement depths unpredictably and therefor altering the accuracy of readings. While the data from this group is less consistent, it loosely follows the same pattern as Group 6's data.

Figure 4:

This is the standard curve of Total Nitrogen (ug/L) vs. Area with our group's data superimposed over it in red. Clearly our data fits the standard curve.

Figure 5:

This is a comparison of the data distribution of total nitrogen between the epilimnion and hypolimnion depths. They are quite similar, with epilimnion TN varying between .17 and .46 mg/L and hypolimnion between .13 and .49 mg/L. These higher values are considered to be outliers, and the interquartile range for both strata is between .2 and .3 mg/L. This shows a relatively uniform distribution on Nitrogen in the water column. Figure 6 is another helpful visualization of this.

```{r}
print(N_Totals)
```

Figure 6:

This is a comparison of total nitrogen in the epilimnion and hypolimnion from all group samples. The hypolimnion has been found to have sligntly more N than the Epilimnion in Horsetooth Reservoir.

Figure 7:

This boxplot shows the range of values of Chlorophyll A in the epilimnion as collected by all groups, as well as the replicate samples from Group 4. Chlorophyll A measurements vary between .51 and .001 ug/L, with 50% of the data falling between \~.1 and \~.3 ug/L.

Figure 8:

This is a comparison of dissolved organic carbon at epilimnion and hypolimnion depths. The plot on the left represents values from all samples before dilution and shows that the epilimnion has a much wider range of concentration of DOC, with 50% of measurements falling between \~1.5 and \~3.4. The hypolimnion samples show much less variance, with the bulk of the data hovering around 1.5 and 2.1 mg/Lm, with some notable outliers closer to 3.5 mg/L.

The plot on the right shows DOC values after the samples had been diluted, a value of 6.73 mg/L has been omitted from the Epilimnion Samples as it dramatically skewed the plot. These diluted samples show a similar pattern as the other plot, with DOC in the epilimnion being more variable than in the hypolimnion.

Figure 9:

This plot shows mean secchi depth by group, it shows that most groups observed an average secchi depth of about 2.5 to 2.6m depth, while Group 2 observed secchi depth at \~2.3m and Group 3 observed it at \~2.8m. The variance in individual observations is better visualized in Figure 10.

Figure 10:

This plot shows secchi depth observations by individual and accounts for some of the variability in the averaged values of Figure 9. It demonstrates how individual observers in the same location and time may have significant variance in readings. These can be attributed to differences in eyesight, cloud cover, or simple human error. While Groups 2 and 3 remain outliers, the other groups can be seen to be relatively uniform.

Comment on the phytoplankton diversity value you calculated.

Calculations done with provided R script and data shown below, Pulchritia used as stand in for Rotifer species as online review leads us to believe this is the correct species, but the LandCare database did not present it as an option:

![](FinalProject/PhytoplanktonDiversity.png)

**What was your Shannon index value? Is this considered high or low?** 

1.080317

Shannon index values are typically between 1.5 and 3.4. Ours was calculated to be 1.08, this is low and represents a low density of phytoplankton in our samples.

**What was your Simpson index value? Is this considered high or low?** 

0.6127385

The upper limit of the Simpson index is 1, so our value of .61 is not particularly high.

Comparison with other groups could grant insight as to whether our observations are the norm or the enigma. These low values might be attributable to a rushed sampling process, as our group was the last to sample for phytoplankton and the boats began moving as we began sampling, resulting in a diagonal drag through the water column.
